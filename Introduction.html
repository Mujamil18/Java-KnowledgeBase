        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <h3>What is Programming?</h3>
<p>A program is a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer to perform a specific task. Your program will do exactly what you tell it to do. Nothing extra and nothing less.</p>
<div>
<p>There are so many programming languages to instruct the computer and interact with it. One of the programming languages is Java. Every programming language has its own features. Java also has its own.
</p>

<h3>Computer</h3>
<p>A computer is a hardware machine. To list some computers: your laptop, your smartphone, your smartwatch, your fridge, etc. Almost every computer has input devices, output devices, CPU(central processing unit), RAM(random access memory), auxiliary memory(secondary memory).</p>

<p><strong>CPU</strong>(central processing unit) is the brain of the computer that executes program instructions. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output operations.</p>

<p><strong>RAM</strong>(random access memory) holds data of the current running program. The data stored in RAM disappears when you shut down your computer. RAM is much faster than auxiliary memory.</p>

<p><strong>Auxiliary memory:</strong> The data remains in auxiliary memory when the computerâ€™s power is off. Hard Driver is an auxiliary(secondary memory).</p>

<h2>Java Programming</h2>

	  	<p>Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language.
Java was initiated by James Gosling and developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. (Now occupied and improvising by Oracle)
Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1995. It promised <em>"WRITE ONCE, RUN ANYWHERE"</em>, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms.
Sun Microsystems made all of Java's core code free and Open Source.
(You can visit this <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/" target="_blank">website</a> to view the Java Documentation by Oracle.)</p>

<h3>Installing Java</h3>
<p>You need JDK(Java Development Kit) to be installed on your computer to run Java programs.</p>
<!-- </div> -->

<!-- <div class="setting-div"> -->
<h3>Setting Up the Path</h3>
<p>After installing JDK on your computer, you need to set up environmental variable.  Environmental variable PATH should be set to point to where the Java binaries have been installed.</p>
<!-- </div> -->

<h3>Writing Java Programs</h3>
<p>To write Java programs, you will need a text editor / notepad.
Instead of using text editor, there are many sophisticated IDEs available in the market.
(For now, using a text editor can be the best practice.)</p>

<p>Let's know why the Java Programming Language is used widely in Application Development.</p>
